# Greeting Card Project Documentation

## Overview

The **Greeting Card Project** is a simple web application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic greeting card with two main components: `Header` and `GreetingCard`. The goal of this project is to showcase the use of **React** components, **props**, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, while leveraging **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and build times.

### Objectives
- **Learn React fundamentals**: Build and use functional components, understand props, state, and component reusability.
- **Explore Vite**: Use Vite as the build tool for quick development setup and faster hot module replacement (HMR).
- **Use Tailwind CSS for Styling**: Implement utility-first CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **Create a Greeting Card**: Develop a greeting card component that accepts dynamic content through props, such as a message and sender's name.

## Project Structure

```
/greeting-card-project
├── /src
│   ├── /components
│   │   ├── Header.jsx
│   │   └── GreetingCard.jsx
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── index.css
│   └── main.jsx
├── tailwind.config.js
└── package.json
```

- **`/components/Header.jsx`**: A simple component displaying the header section of the greeting card.
- **`/components/GreetingCard.jsx`**: The main greeting card component that takes dynamic content (props) and displays a message.
- **`App.jsx`**: The main application component that renders the `Header` and `GreetingCard` components.
- **`index.css`**: The main stylesheet, which imports Tailwind's utilities for styling.
- **`main.jsx`**: The entry point of the React application that renders the root component (`App`).

## Key Components

- The `Header` component uses **Tailwind CSS** classes for styling, including background color (`bg-blue-500`), text color (`text-white`), padding (`py-5`), and font size (`text-3xl`).

- The `GreetingCard` component is styled with Tailwind CSS classes for layout and typography. The `message` and `sender` are inserted dynamically based on the props passed from the parent component (`App`).

### 3. **App Component**
The `App` component imports and uses the `Header` and `GreetingCard` components, passing the appropriate props to `GreetingCard`.

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import Header from './components/Header';
import GreetingCard from './components/GreetingCard';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
      <Header />
      <GreetingCard message="Wishing you a wonderful day!" sender="Your Friend" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- In the `App` component, the `GreetingCard` is rendered with a custom greeting message and sender name. The `Header` component is displayed at the top.

## Tailwind CSS Setup

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the project, enabling a utility-first approach to design. Here's how it is set up:

1. **Tailwind Configuration**:
   - In the `tailwind.config.js`, we ensure Tailwind processes the relevant files to generate the necessary styles.
   
   ```js
   // tailwind.config.js
   export default {
     content: [
       "./index.html",
       "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

2. **Global Styles**:
   - Tailwind's base, components, and utilities are imported into `src/index.css` to apply global styles.
   
   ```css
   /* src/index.css */
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

## What I Learned

1. **React Components and Props**: 
   - This project helped me solidify my understanding of functional components and props in React. I learned how to pass dynamic content from a parent component (`App`) to a child component (`GreetingCard`) using props.

2. **Vite as a Build Tool**:
   - I explored the benefits of using **Vite** as a build tool for a React project. The fast build times and instant hot module replacement (HMR) greatly improved the development experience. 

3. **Tailwind CSS**:
   - I became more comfortable with **Tailwind CSS** and learned how to use utility classes for rapid prototyping and styling. The responsive design and customization options made it easier to create a visually appealing greeting card.

4. **Component Reusability**:
   - By utilizing props in the `GreetingCard` component, I learned how to make components dynamic and reusable. This makes the component flexible enough to accept different messages and sender names.

## Conclusion

The **Greeting Card Project** is a great example of how to combine **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** to create a simple but dynamic web application. Through this project, I gained valuable experience with React components, props, and modern build tools, while also learning how to quickly style an application using Tailwind CSS.

This project serves as a foundation for more complex applications, where similar patterns of component composition, prop passing, and responsive design can be applied.
